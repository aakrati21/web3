    Returns balance of given account

    Approve spender to spend tokens on owner's behalf

    Transfer tokens from one address to another using allowance mechanism

    Owner can burn tokens from an account
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {

        uint256 burnAmount = amount * 10**decimals;
        require(balances[account] >= burnAmount, "Burn amount exceeds balance");

        balances[account] -= burnAmount;
        totalSupply -= burnAmount;

        emit Transfer(account, address(0), burnAmount);
    }
